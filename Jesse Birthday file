    <div class="friend-name">Sophia</div>
    <div class="question">When did you and Jesse first meet?</div>
    <p>We met in 8th grade when we were both new to school and instantly clicked!</p>

    <div class="question">Your favorite memory together?</div>
    <p>When we built a pillow fort and binge-watched movies all night. Best sleepover ever!</p>

    <div class="question">How well do you know Jesse?</div>
    <p>Very well! I even know her favorite ice cream flavor is mint chocolate chip and her secret talent is beatboxing.</p>

    <div class="friend-name">Daniel</div>

    <p>First day of college orientation! We were both lost and ended up finding the cafeteria together 😂</p>

    <div class="question">Your favorite memory together?</div>
    <p>The road trip to the beach — we got sunburned but had the best playlist blasting all the way.</p>

    <div class="question">How well do you know Jesse?</div>
    <p>She's always singing in the shower, obsessed with sushi, and cries during animal rescue videos.</p>

    <p>At summer camp! We were bunkmates and became instant besties after one game of truth or dare.</p>

    <div class="question">Your favorite memory together?</div>
    <p>Cooking dinner together and accidentally setting off the fire alarm. We laughed so hard we cried!</p>
